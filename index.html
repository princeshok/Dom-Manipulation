	<h1>Dom Minapulation</h1>

	<p>Dom manipulation is a way to add element to a page.</p>

	<h3>Difference between Append and AppendChild</h3>

	<p>append() also allows you to append DOMString objects, and it has no return value. Further, parentNode. appendchild() allows you to append only one node, while parentNode. append() supports multiple arguments - so you can append several nodes and strings</p>

	<h3>TextContents and InnerText</h3>

	<p>textContents is all text contained by an element and all its children that are for formatting purposes only. innerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements. innerHtml returns all text, including html tags, that is contained by an element.</p>

		//* 1. BMI Calculator


		     //Build a program that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI)based on their height and weight. The program should prompt the userto enter their height (in meters)and weight (in kilometer), and thencalculate and display their BMI.

       //* 2. Driving License Eligibility


             //Create a program that checks a
             //person is eligible a driver 
             //license based on their age. The 
             //program should prompt the user enter their age and then display a message indicating whether they are 
             //eligiblefor a driver driver 
             //license or not.

		      //let driver_license = prompt("what's your age")

		       //if(driver_license >= 18)
		       //console.log("eligible_for_driver_license")

		       //if(driver_license < 18)
		       	//console.log("not_eligible_license")


		       
		//* 3. Age Group Classifier

			//Write a program that classifies a person into different age groups based on their age. The program should prompt the user to enter their age and then display a message indicating which age group they belong to (e.g., child, teenager, adult, senior). Use a Switch statement

		       
		       //let age_group = prompt("what's your age")
		       //if (age_group >= 1 && age_group <= 10)
		       	//console.log("child")


		       //if (age_group >= 12 && age_group <= 17)
		       	//console.log("teenager")

		       //if(age_group >= 18 && age_group <= 39)
		       	//console.log("adult")

		       //if(age_group >= 40)
		       	//console.log("senior") 



		       



		//* 4. Multiply

			//Create a function called 'multiply' that takes two parameters and returns their product.

		       //function multiply(b, c) {
		       	//return b * c;
		      // }

		       //example use

		       //var result = multiply(8 , 9)
		       //console.log("The product is:" + result);

		       //output = 72




		      

			
		//* 5. Divide

			//Create a function called 'divide' that takes two parameters and returns their quotient.

		       function divide(b , c)
		      if (b ! == 0){
		       	return a / b;
		      } else {
		       	throw new error("division by 0 is not allow.")
		       }

		        Example use
		       try {
		       	var result = divide(20 , 5)
		       	console.log("The quotient is:" * result) 
		       } // Output
			
		//* 6. Subtract

			//Create a function called 'subtract' that takes two parameters and returns their difference.
			
		//* 7. isEven

			//Create a function called 'isEven' that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if it's even, otherwise false.
			
		//* 8. Temperature

			//Write an if-else statement that checks if a variable 'temperature' is greater than 30 and prints "It's hot" if true, otherwise, print "It's not so hot".
